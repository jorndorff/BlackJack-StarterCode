Black Jack Strategy Generator
=============================

About This Project
------------------
This project uses arrays to keep track of odds for the game Black Jack. If you are not familiar with the game, take a minute and read the rules. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is one good source. In this lab we will use a slightly simplified version of the game in which the user can only choose to Hit or Stay. No splitting or doubling down.


The program seeks to answer this question: Given a blackjack hand, should I hit or stay? Your program will run simulations to help answer this question. To run these simulations, you will need the following methods:


The BlackJack Class
-------------------
This class defines several useful methods for simulating black jack games. The required methods are outlined in the `BlackJack.java` file. Implement them there, and document them with javadoc.

The Main Program
----------------
Thile the BlackJack class will be useful for several different black jack related programs, our current task 

Your program will deal the user 2 cards and, assuming you donâ€™t already have BlackJack, will choose whether or not to hit based on the current odds. Find a way to record each time whether hitting on a given number was successful. How you choose to record this is up to you, but once your simulation is complete, it should offer the odds that you SHOULD hit at any given total. 


For example:

| HAND | ODDS |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0    | N/A  |
| 1    | N/A  |
| 2    |    1 |
| 3    |    1 |
| 4    |    1 |
| 5    |    1 |
| 6    |    1 |
| 7    |    1 |
| 8    |    1 |
| 9    |    1 |
| 10   |    1 |
| 11   |    1 |
| 12   |  .70 |
| 13   |  .67 |
| 14   |  .53 |
| 15   |  .45 |
| 16   |  .31 |
| 17   |  .21 |
| 18   |  .12 |
| 19   |  .07 |
| 20   |  .02 |
            
The exact odds will be different every time, especially for a small number of simulated hands, but these are representative. Any total 11 or lower should always result in a successful hit and as your number increases, the odds of a successful hit should decrease. 


Once you have all this, I should be able to actually play blackjack in AC and trust your program whether or not I should hit. Consider this following main method:

```
public static void main(String [] args)
{
    // Ultimate results variable
    double[] odds;


    int[] deck = buildDeck();
    shuffle(deck);
    
    int[] thisResult = simulate(deck, 1000);
    
    // Make the final calculation
    odds = calculateOdds();
    System.out.println(shouldIHit(14));
}
```

The Assignment
--------------

* Comment your code in JavaDoc format.

* Your code should be well-commented and stylistically correct. 

* Make sure to update this document so it reads as an actual documentation rather than an assignment. (Hint remove this section.)

* For some extra street cred: Make a "dealer" player that is also taking cards from the deck and behaving according to normal dealer rules. When you stay, figure out if staying led to you winning or losing. Update your odds accordingly.

* For even more street cred, allow the options to split or double down.

* For even more street cred allow a different number of decks in the shoe. A common value in casinos is six decks per shoe.
